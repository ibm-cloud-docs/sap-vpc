# Bring your own SAP product license
{: #bring-your-own-sap-product-license}

The {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} SAP-Certified infrastructure is "bring your own license" (BYOL) capable for your SAP products. You need to apply the corresponding license for your SAP products after installation. If you are new to SAP, start exploring under [SAP All Products](https://www.sap.com/products.html){: external}. You can also contact SAP Sales or SAP Support for details on how to obtain the required licenses.

If you purchased your SAP and Db2 licenses as part of an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) application-specific licensing (ASL) agreement, you can download and apply license files from the [SAP Support Portal)](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html){: external}; click **Download Software**. For more information, see [SAP Note 816773 - DB6: Installing the Application-Specific Db2 License from SAP](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/816773){: external}.

However, if you purchased Db2 from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} or an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Business Partner, you must use the license files that are provided by your vendor instead.
